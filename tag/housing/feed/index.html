		<description><![CDATA[HI Everyone, we have finally got our large house. It is in Lavender Beds, Ward 1, Plot 36

We did have to set up a new FC, but it will be exactly the same as the current Wild Tonberries, even the name once it is changed.

Message myself, Haoji, or any other member that is online for an invite, or join us on Discord. https://goo.gl/Sbba5B.

		<description><![CDATA[Update: We are done, the extra work is appreciated!  Now just to wait for housing to open up!

Some members have created alt characters to level in it, but it's completely optional and we are not switching our main characters until we get a new house.

Join the new Discord Chat (see post below) and we can keep in touch and switch between characters if you need any help.

Happy adventuring!]]></description>
