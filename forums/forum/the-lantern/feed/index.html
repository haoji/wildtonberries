						<p>Hey everyone, the name&#8217;s Ksenia or Kairi on here haha. I am a college student who&#8217;s studying nursing so that&#8217;s why I am not on as much as I would like to be. I stopped playing since December of 2015 so I have a lot of catching up to do, but I am excited to play with a group that seems very kind and fun to be around!!</p>

						<p>Hi, my name is Flora and I&#8217;ve been playing this game since beta. I quit almost 2 years ago because I had my second kid and didn&#8217;t have time anymore. Now that he&#8217;s older I am back!</p>
<p>I have a lot of catching up to do, but so far things are going great! I am so happy to be a part of such a friendly and knowledgeable FC. I switch back and forth between PC and PS3 depending on what&#8217;s available in my busy house of technophiles.</p>
<p>Currently my only 50+ is whm, but I have 50 CUL and FSH too which I will be leveling shortly. Thanks for the invite!</p>
<p>On a side note, if i randomly log off without saying goodbye don&#8217;t be offended. With two small children I get interrupted constantly.</p>

						<![CDATA[
						<p>Hello, my character is <em>Milena Voivodess</em> ingame, but I also played in ARR as <em>Andreas Vilhjalmsson</em>, and <em>Krzesimir Thaliakan</em>. The main names I use online are Paragon (in discord chat) and TheEyesightDim, I&#8217;ve been playing since the beta but I&#8217;ve taken lots of breaks so my playtime isn&#8217;t as high as many people&#8230;still, I have a lot of experience.</p>
<p>IRL, I study computer science, play music, and learn some languages. But here I&#8217;m just a goof. ðŸ˜›</p>
