<p>So basically if you watch this video, you can apparently drop both meteor markers on top of each other. Thus, not spawning the adds. Instead of doing the whole, one in the back, and one in the inner ring. I dunno if it works or not, but it seemed to work for this group. Just thought I&#8217;d share.</p>

						<![CDATA[
						<p>I will be editing this topic with updated info, removing old out of date links or sites that are no longer updated.</p>
<p><a href="http://xivdb.com/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">FFXIV Database</a><br />
I find this to be one of the best locations for all FFXIV info, including items, quests, fates, recipes, etc. Sometimes there will be incorrect info, but this seems to be one of the most thorough databases i have seen for FFXIV info, even more than what the Libra Eorzea app provides.</p>
<p><a href="http://na.finalfantasyxiv.com/lodestone/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">FFXIV Lodestone</a><br />
Of course this is the official FFXIV website and forums, and is the best place to keep up to date on any game announcements.</p>
<p><a href="http://na.finalfantasyxiv.com/lodestone/playguide/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Eorzea Database</a><br />
This probably IS the most comprehensive database of FFXIV info there is. You can look up the most recent info here, usually before it is available on xivdb.com. Although xivdb.com has an easier search system, and comments regarding many items, including specific locations or requirements for getting the item.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.ffxivguild.com/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">FFXIV Guild</a><br />
Fan based site that has lots of comprehensive info, including staying regularly up to date on the game, guides for primals, plus crafting/gathering guides for the best melds.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.ffxivgardening.com" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">FFXIV Gardening</a><br />
An excellent site that gives breakdowns on gardening cross-breeding. Also use the <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/lv?key=0Aj-i0C8Ke8EcdDFrVG51eEVKSjdWeFdaemFHSk1NQVE&amp;f=true&amp;noheader=false&amp;gid=7" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">crossbreed spreadsheet</a> to easily find the plants you want. &#8211; They have phased this out, and it is no longer being regularly updated. &#8211;</p>
<p><a href="http://ffxivclock.com" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">FFXIV Clock</a><br />
this is a real time clock that tells you all of the gathering locations and slots for lvl 50 unspoiled mining and botany nodes, as well as fishing times. If you click on the specific items you want to gather, they will show up at the top, and a pop up will let you know when it is time to gather them. &#8211; it was also recently updated to be more accurate, show working countdowns in real time until next node, and includes folklore and ephemeral gathering times and locations, even for fishing.</p>
<p><a href="http://forum.square-enix.com/ffxiv/threads/183112-Best-Materia-Setup-for-Crafters-%28Updated-for-2.3%29" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Crafting materia guide</a><br />
This is another good crafting guide, that is updated up to 2.3, so it doesnt have the newer items.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.garytay.net/ffxiv_macro/" rel="nofollow">Crafting Macro Generator</a><br />
This is a fantastic tool that allow you to plan out your macros and then once you generate the macro, you can copy and paste it into the game (on the PC at least). Its great for not having to worry about every single step for crafting materials and items.</p>
<p><a href="http://ffxivhunt.com/sargatanas" rel="nofollow">FFXIV Hunts</a><br />
This is a comprehensive list of all the hunt monsters, their locations, timers until they CAN spawn, not a guarantee that they will be spawned yet&#8230; which links to&#8230;</p>
<p><a href="http://forum.square-enix.com/ffxiv/threads/185390-Let-s-talk-about-Hunts-a-detailed-rundown-of-their-assumed-mechanics" rel="nofollow">Hunt info</a><br />
This gives specific information regarding how the S Rank hunt monsters spawn, and what you can do to actually help them spawn. Very useful info. Also here is a rough map of the <a class="d4pbbc-url" target="_blank" href="http://imgur.com/a/cwymN#1" rel="nofollow">hunt spawn locations.</a></p>
<p><a href="http://ffxiv.consolegameswiki.com/wiki/Sightseeing_Log" rel="nofollow">Sightseeing Log</a><br />
Here is a guide for the sightseeing log, helps you find all of the locations and the requirements to &#8220;unlock&#8221; it.</p>
<p><a href="http://forum.square-enix.com/ffxiv/threads/181498-Desynthesis-Endgame-Guide" rel="nofollow">And here is a desynth guide</a></p>
<p><a href="http://ffxiv.consolegameswiki.com/wiki/FF14_Wiki" rel="nofollow">FFXIV Wiki</a><br />
Comprehensive Wiki of all things FFXIV. very useful for learning dungeons/raids/etc.</p>
<p><a href="http://forum.square-enix.com/ffxiv/threads/245872-Airship-Guide" rel="nofollow">Airship Guide</a></p>
<p>This is the most comprehensive information i have found regarding the use of airships, unlocking new sectors, items that can come from sectors, and best routes, etc. Its a little daunting but a must have for anyone who wants to understand all their is to know about airships in Heavensward.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I will add more updated guides and tips as i have the chance.</p>

						<p>For those of you that are just getting started an outlined below the zones you should be leveling and completing FATEs in by player level. It’s important to make use of each area as you level up. Once you get to a point where you have to Level Sync more often than not, move on to the next zone. This way you’ll gain as much experience, gil, and other rewards as possible while completing FATEs.</p>
<p>Levels 1-12: Horizon’s Edge (Located in Western Thanalan)<br />
Levels 13-20: Aleport (Located in Western La Noscea)<br />
Levels 21-30: Quarrymill (Located in the Silent Arbor area of South Shroud)<br />
Levels 28-34: Wineport (Located in the Raincatcher Gully area of Eastern La Noscea)<br />
Levels 30-38: Dragonhead (Located in the Central Highlands area of Coerthas)<br />
Levels 38-42: Camp Revenant’s Toll (Located in the Fogfens area of Mor Dhona)<br />
Levels 42-50: Ceruleum Processing Plant (Located in the Bluefog area of Northern Thanalan)<br />
Levels 52-60: The Churning Mists</p>
<p>NOTE: Also keep in mind that these areas have Levemete NPCs within them that will offer you levequests to complete for even more XP if you want. FATEs are faster but picking up a quest here and there can help it not feel as much like grinding.</p>

						<p>The number one stat you need to boost is patience. As with RL, all your plants will not fully grow over night. If you are gathering your seeds/soils, you will need 2x the patience since soils/seed will not pop up on every gathering attempt including grade 1 and 2 soils.</p>
<p><strong class="d4pbbc-bold"><span class="d4pbbc-font-size" style="font-size: 5px">Now, let&#8217;s get started</span></strong><br />
Gardening can seem intimidating with all the seeds/tending/fertilizing/soils, but it&#8217;s not actually that complex at all. If you have botany/mining leveled up, then you will already have a head-start on the game, since the seeds/soils on the market board can be over-priced or scarce. Seeds may be harvested, bought, and/or may be a product of cross-breeding(we&#8217;ll cover this later). Soils come in 3 grades:</p>
<p><span class="d4pbbc-underline" style="text-decoration: underline;">QUARRYING</span>_______________________________________________________________________<br />
<strong class="d4pbbc-bold">La Noscean Topsoil &#8211; Increases the chances for HQ yield</strong><br />
Grade 1 La Noscean Topsoil: Lower La Noscea (Cedarwood area) Lv 30 RARE ITEM<br />
Grade 2 La Noscean Topsoil: Lower La Noscea (Gods&#8217; Grip area) Lv 50 RARE ITEM<br />
Grade 3 La Noscean Topsoil: Middle La Noscea(Zephyr Gate area) Lv50* UNSPOILED NODE (8 AM)<br />
__________________________________________________________________________________<br />
<strong class="d4pbbc-bold">Thanalan Topsoil &#8211; Increases the chances of inter-crossing</strong><br />
Grade 1 Thanalan Topsoil: Eastern Thanalan (Wellwick Wood area) Lv 30 RARE ITEM<br />
Grade 2 Thanalan Topsoil: Western Thanalan (Nophica&#8217;s Wells area) lv 50 RARE ITEM<br />
Grade 3 Thanalan Topsoil: Western Thanalan (Beaconhill Lighthouse area) Lv 50* UNSPOILED NODE (5 AM)<br />
__________________________________________________________________________________<br />
<strong class="d4pbbc-bold">Shroud Topsoil &#8211; Increases the amount of yield</strong><br />
Grade 1 Shroud Topsoil: East Shroud (Nine Ivies area) Lv 30 RARE ITEM<br />
Grade 2 Shroud Topsoil: East Shroud (Bramble Patch area) Lv 50 RARE ITEM<br />
Grade 3 Shroud Topsoil: South Shroud (Camp Tranquil area) Lv 50* UNSPOILED NODE (6 AM)<br />
*If at lvl 50 then you may need to use abilities/meld to get the item reliably. If beyond lvl 50, then just have at it!<br />
**side note: all soils are rare items, meaning you can gather only one per node no matter what abilities you use<br />
__________________________________________________________________________________</p>
<p>There are no real solid numbers on the percentages/yield increase of each grade of soil, but there are some estimates/personal experience that I have come across:<br />
&#8211; Grade 3 Shroud Topsoil + Krakka root seeds = 18 Krakka roots per yield<br />
&#8211; Grade 2 Shroud Topsoil + Krakka root seeds = 12-14 Krakka roots per yield<br />
&#8211; Grade 3 Thanalan Topsoil is estimated to increase inter-crossing chances by 90%<br />
&#8211; Grade 2 Thanalan Topsoil is estimated to increase inter-crossing chances by 50%</p>
<p>My guess for La Noscean Topsoil is that the chances of HQing are scaled similarly to Thanalan topsoil. Grade 1 Topsoils don&#8217;t have much info out there, so I will make assumptions based on the gathered figures above. I would suspect that crops will yield only 2-3 more for Shroud and maybe a 20ish% chance increase for Thanalan/La Noscean Topsoil.</p>
<p><span class="d4pbbc-font-size" style="font-size: 5px">Have that down? Good! Time to plant!</span><br />
Your gardening bed will have 8 slots to put your soils and seeds. Depending on your plans, you&#8217;ll have to select what type of soil goes best with your seeds. For example, say I want to grow Xelphatol Apples for the Free Company and would like to get the max yields. I would use Grade 3 Shroud Topsoil to go along with my Xelphatol Apple seeds.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s a visual:</p>
<p>[ 1 ] [ 2 ] [ 3 ]<br />
[ 8 ] [ x ] [ 4 ]<br />
[ 7 ] [ 6 ] [ 5 ]</p>
<p>Numbers &#8211; represents the plot order<br />
X &#8211; represents the space in the middle of the bed that can&#8217;t be used for anything</p>
<p>I can put the Xelphatol Apple seeds in any order on the bed and it will not have any effect on the crops. I could even mix it up and put other plants and fruits in there to grow them simultaneously. Just know that different seeds take different amounts of time to grow. The Xelphatol Apples would take 2 RL days to grow, as opposed to Hazelnut which would take 7 days to grow.</p>
<p><span class="d4pbbc-font-size" style="font-size: 5px">WATER YOUR PLANTS(Tend)!!!</span><br />
Even digital plants and fruits need some TLC. I have seen FC members, time and time again, just plant their seeds and come back days later to some withered/dead crops. Plan to tend your crops at least once every 16-24 RL hours! If you can&#8217;t log on to tend your garden, then ask someone on your Friends List or in your Free Company to come tend your plants. In addition to &#8220;Tend,&#8221; there is a &#8220;Fertilize&#8221; option. Fertilizing your crops can reduce the grow time of your crop by 1 RL hour, yet it can be done only once every RL hour. Fishmeal is the item you need for fertilizing and can be bought cheaply at a material supplies vendor(location varies upon what Grand Company area you are currently in).</p>
<p><span class="d4pbbc-font-size" style="font-size: 5px">Inter-crossing Plants</span><br />
<span class="d4pbbc-font-size" style="font-size: 4px">What&#8217;s that? You need to grow seeds to make seeds? STEP RIGHT THIS WAY FRIEND!</span><br />
Have you ever seen items that cost a good chunk of gil on the Market Board and later find out they come from gardening? Only to think, &#8220;That much gil for something that takes a couple days to grow?&#8221; Well, here&#8217;s why they cost so much: the items can take 1-3 RL weeks to get the right results and grow! Not to mention some crossbreeding can have 2 different results which may end up leaving you with seeds that you don&#8217;t need(s)! &gt;.&gt;</p>
<p>For this type of gardening, soil grade and plot order are super important! For best results use Grade 3 Thanalan Topsoil, but if you don&#8217;t have the time/class/gil for it, then Grade 2 is your next best bet. Use Grade 1 at your own peril.<br />
Let&#8217;s say you want to grow Mimett Gourds for your chocobo needs. Mimmet Gourd seeds only come from inter-crossing seeds. Now there are a multiple number of seeds we can cross to get the Mimett Gourd seeds, but for best results(higher chances of crossing) we&#8217;ll go with crossing Mandrake seeds and Xelphatol Apple seeds. Mandrake seeds take 5 days to fully grow and Xelphatol Apple seeds take only 2 days to grow. For Inter-crossing we will plant them (in plot order) as such:</p>
<p>[ m ] [ x ] [ m ]<br />
[ x ] [ v ] [ x ]<br />
[ m ] [ x ] [ m ]</p>
<p>*M &#8211; Mandrake seeds<br />
*X &#8211; Xelphatol Apple seeds<br />
*V &#8211; Unusable spot</p>
<p>You&#8217;ll have your first results in just 2 days! Harvest your Xelphatol Apples and with luck, you&#8217;ll get Mimett Gourd seeds along with them. If you have &#8220;bad&#8221; luck, then you&#8217;ll get the other result from inter-crossing these two, Onion Prince seeds. Now i said &#8220;bad&#8221; because they&#8217;re not what you want. Yet the will sell for an okay chunk of gil(currently) on the Market Board. Now if you have worse luck, then you&#8217;ll only get your Xelphatol Apples, no seeds of any kind.</p>
<p>You will have 2 options at this point, wait 3 more days for your Mandrake seeds to grow and see if you get any Mimett Gourd seeds with them OR plant more Xelphatol Apple seeds in the plots that you just harvested! They will still inter-cross and get you a 2 more chances of getting more Mimmet Gourd seeds. Another way of looking at it:</p>
<p><span class="d4pbbc-underline" style="text-decoration: underline;">Choosing the first route</span><br />
Wait 2 days: Harvest Xelphatol Apples &#8211; get seeds(if any)<br />
Wait 3 more days: Harvest Mandrakes &#8211; get seeds(if any)</p>
<p><span class="d4pbbc-underline" style="text-decoration: underline;">Choosing the second route</span><br />
Wait 2 days: Harvest Xelphatol Apples &#8211; get seeds(if any)<br />
Plant more Xelphatol Apple seeds<br />
Wait 2 days: Harvest Xelphatol Apples &#8211; get seeds(if any)<br />
Plant more Xelphatol Apple seeds<br />
Wait 1 day: Harvest Mandrakes &#8211; get seeds(if any)<br />
Wait 1 day: Harvest Xelphatol Apples &#8211; get seeds(if any)</p>
<p>Personally, I chose the first route if I&#8217;m low on resources (aka topsoils) or don&#8217;t really need that many. If you have topsoils/time galore, then route 2 is just PROFIT.<br />
Remember that you still need time to actually grow your end result seeds. For that particular seed, we would still of needed 5 RL days to grow the Mimett Gourds on top of all that previous work done.</p>
<p><span class="d4pbbc-font-size" style="font-size: 5px">Congrats! You&#8217;ve graduated gardening school!</span><br />
I have now planted my seed of knowledge(deep in you). It is time for you to branch out. Growth will depend on your experiences. My job of giving you a general direction is done. GTFO</p>
<p><span class="d4pbbc-font-size" style="font-size: 5px">Still need more guidance?!</span><br />
